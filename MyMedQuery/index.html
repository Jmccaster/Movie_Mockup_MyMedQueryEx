        He is a high school student living in Queens, NYC, who acquired
        superhuman abilities after receiving a bite from an experimental spider
        during a school field trip. Publicly, he works as a photographer for the
        Daily Bugle, and gains notoriety for capturing photos of his alter ego
        fighting crime in New York City. He began dating his childhood and high
        school crush named Mary Jane Watson, who earns a living as a model and
        an actress. Spider-Man battles many foes throughout the Sam Raimi
        trilogy of films, such as the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, The Sandman,
        and Eddie Brock a.k.a. Venom. Peter later encountered alternate versions
        of Spider-Man from across the multiverse and aided them in curing a
        number of villains, including the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus and the
        Sandman.

        The Amazing Spider-Man is a film series directed by Marc Webb, featuring
        the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man. Sony hired comic book fan Marc
        Webb to direct the films, which featured a new cast including Andrew
        Garfield as Peter Parker, Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, and Rhys Ifans as
        Dr. Curt Connors. The reboot's intention was to have Peter Parker
        develop his abilities in high school once again. The reboot, The Amazing
        Spider-Man was released in 2012 to positive reviews, and its sequel, The
        Amazing Spider-Man 2 was released in 2014 to mixed reviews. Thus far,
        Webb's films have been produced on a total budget of $480 million and
        have grossed over $1.4 billion. A crossover/sequel to the franchise
        Spider-Man: No Way Home continued the stories of characters such as
        Spider-Man, Electro and the Lizard.

        Peter Parker is a high school student and a superhero who possesses
        spider-like abilities due to a spider-bite and uses his superpowers to
        fight crime under the alter ego of Spider-Man. Despite his best efforts
        to keep his identity secret from the world, he was found and recruited
        by Tony Stark, gaining a new suit and technology in exchange. Peter
        Parker forged a name for himself in New York City and became well-known
        as a local neighborhood hero, fighting against Vulture, who is creating
        advanced weapons from stolen alien technology. After defeating Vulture,
        Peter discover the true responsibilities of a hero, so he decided to
        decline Stark's offer of membership in the Avengers in order to continue
        helping the little guy however he could. When Thanos and his Black Order
        launched an attack on New York in search of the Time Stone, Peter helped
        Iron Man and Doctor Strange fend off the invaders. He and Stark stowed
        away aboard the Black Order's ship to rescue Strange from Ebony Maw, who
        he and Iron Man threw from the ship while going to the planet Titan.
        Peter was “knighted” as an official Avenger after this feat. There,
        Parker battled Thanos only for a despot to beat him into submission.
        Later Parker along with the rest of half of the universe were
        disintegrated once Thanos completed the Infinity Gauntlet.
